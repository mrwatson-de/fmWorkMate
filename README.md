# fmWorkMate
[Makes FileMaker Work]

fmWorkMate is a power toolkit for FileMaker Developers from MrWatson of [mrwatson.de][mrwatson.de] and [fmworkmate.com][fmworkmate.com]

  ![Winner of the FileMaker Magazine Award for best FileMaker Tool 2018][FMM-Award 2018]

## Congratulations!
You have found fmWorkMate, the award-winning, free, open-source productivity toolkit for FileMaker developers from [MrWatson]!

LOTS has changed in fmWorkMate!

- fmWorkMate is now simply FileMaker files; the runtime version is no more ;-D
- fmWorkMate is now OPEN SOURCE, available on [GitHub][fmWorkMate repo] and under a [MIT LICENCE][LICENCE] !  ðŸ‘€ ðŸ˜ƒ
- There are *loads* of new functions!(1)

The consequence of this is

- You'll need to bring your own [MBS licence][MBS-Plugin] [BYOL],
- You can take a look under the hood
- You can help make fmWorkMate a better tool - and are heartily invited to do so!

It's a new era - enjoy!

Check out the Website (coming in 2025) for loads more information.

Happy FileMaking!

  - *catches bugs* at inception (fmLogAnalyser's Bug-Off! Alarm)
  - helps you *see bugs* by [making wrong code look wrong](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/05/11/making-wrong-code-look-wrong/)  (fmSyntaxColorizer)
  - lists bugs to *kill* (fmLogAnalyser ToDo list)
  - takes you to *exactly* where the bugs are (fmScriptWorkspace)
  - *avoids* bugs by allowing you to *generate code* (fmCheckMate fmTextMultiplier)
    - (Better than hand coding 5% bugs into your solution!)
  - **proves** you have no bugs (fmLogAnalyser [OK])

- fmWorkMate works how you work!
  - Here and now!
    - fmWorkMate is designed for **immediate** use (and instant gratification ðŸ˜‰ )
    - no need to wait hours for DDRs to be created and analysed

  - Fast and efficient!
    - fmWorkMate is honed for rapid and repetitive tasks


### `It's powerful`

- fmWorkMate provides help in places you need them, where other tools - inc. FileMaker itself - fail:
  - catch errors **as you make them** (fmLogAnalyser & Bug-Off Alarm)
  - find errors in layouts - *in seconds* (fmCheckmate Layout analysis)
  - refactor code
    - relocate functionality to a new context (fmTextConverter)
  - find differences in scripts
- fmWorkMate soothes where FileMaker hurts
  - dock that stupid debugger script window into the script workspace with a click!
  - jump straight to that subscript *in an external file*
  - test field calculations *without* having to add all the (default) table names back in to the data viewer.


### `It's proven`

- fmWorkMate has been in development since 2008 as a hobby alongside my 24*7 FileMaker work,

- It's been used daily be myself (MrWatson), colleagues, and increasingly more FileMaker developers around the world

- fmWorkMate has proven itself to be a valuable tool capable of considerably increasing daily productivity and championing the quality of your FileMaker work

- fmWorkMate was awarded the [FileMaker Magazin Award for Best Tool in 2018][FMM-Awards 2018]

  ![FMM-Award 2018]

### `It's free`
- Always has been.

### `It's wild`

- fmWorkMate is out of the incubator and ready to be wielded!

## Installing fmWorkMate

### To Install fmWorkMate on your Mac:

1. Download the [latest release][fmWorkMate releases] of fmWorkMate from [GitHub][fmWorkMate repo]
2. Move the fmWorkMate folder into the Applications folder (recommended, but anywhere will do)
   - Note: If you also have any sibling tools ([fmAutoMate][fmAutoMate home],  [fmSyntaxColorizer][fmSyntaxColorizer home] or [fmLaunchPad][fmLaunchPad home]) place the folders alongside each other in order to reference these tools from within fmWorkMate

3. Install Plugins, as necessary

   - Download and Install the two plugins, if you don't already have them
     - [Base-Elements Plugin Download](https://docs.baseelementsplugin.com/article/522-downloads) (free, no licence required)
     - [MBS Plugin Download](https://www.monkeybreadsoftware.com/filemaker/)
   - Licence / Register the MBS Plugin
     - You can get a [trial licence for MBS Plugin here](https://www.monkeybreadsoftware.com/trial/trial-filemaker.shtml)

   - If your solution already uses and registers a licenced MBS Plugin *and* you are using fmWorkMate in the *same* FileMaker instance, the MBS Plugin does not need to be registered again.
   - Otherwise, you can get fmWorkMate to register the MBS-Plugin when it starts:
     - Open fmWorkMate in FileMaker and setup plugin registration
       - Click the (i) button, bottom right in fmWorkMate
       - Click The MBS [BYOL] button (BYOL=Bring Your Own Licence)
       - Enter your licence information
       - Press [Register MBS]
     - If you wish to hide your MBS licence information from prying eyes...
       -  Navigate to the second slider panel
       -  Click [Store Licence] to store the current licence information
       -  Return to the first slider panel
       -  Remove your licence information
       -  [OK]

4. Launch fmWorkMate in FileMaker
   You can 
   1. Open fmWorkMate in FileMaker **alongside your databases**
      - The quickest way to get started
      - Has some advanages to interact between fmWorkMate + your files (see [fmAutoMate][fmAutoMate])
      - However, can sometimes be difficult to navigte between database + tool windows 
   2. Open fmWorkMate **in a second FileMaker version/instance**
      - This has the advantage of being able to switch between databases and tools easily
      - (Did you know you it is possible to just duplicate the FileMaker app on Mac?)
   3. Use **fmLaunchpad with a customised fmWorkMate.app** 
      - [fmLaunchPad][fmLaunchPad home] makes it possible to start different FileMaker solutions in different FileMaker apps
      - This takes a [little setting up][fmLaunchPad setup fmWorkMate], but provides a pleasant runtime-like experience

### To Install fmWorkMate on your Windows PC

- Either (for limited, but tried and tested, functionality - since fmWorkMate has not been developed/tested further on Windows since the demise of runtimes):
  - Download and install the old [fmWorkMate Windows Runtime] for basic functionality
  - You can also install fmCheckMate-XSLT
- Or (for a better future for all Windows FM-Devs - but maybe not such a good inital experience  for yourself):
  - Help [contribute] to getting fmWorkmate running on windows!
  - Download and install fmWorkMate as for mac
  - Test it, log [issues here in GitHub](https://github.com/mrwatson-de/fmWorkMate/issues) and [join in][contribute]!

## Using fmWorkMate

Feel free to click around to get to know the tools.

For a more guided start, see the [fmWorkMate documentation](docs/README.md).

---

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Not everything is tested (but core stuff is *used* every day).

- You can break things. Test before you try.

- FileMaker itself does not copy & paste all objects 100% correctly (notably the Import Records script step and the calculation context table in field definitions)

- Pasting entire tables, scripts and custom functions creates new objects with new internal IDs. So you may want to just copy the *contents* of an object

## POKE around

I nearly forgot: If you want to poke around and have a look at the guts of fmWorkMate, you'll need the 'secret' user/password: admin/admin

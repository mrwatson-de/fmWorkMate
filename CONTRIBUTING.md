I would be **delighted** to have your help in improving fmWorkmate for the FileMaker developer community.

Particularly

- fmWorkMate on Windows
  - I'm a Mac user with no time to develop and test stuff on Windows
  - There's probably not a lot that needs tweaking to get it working on Windows
  - Some MBS-based functionality is not possible on windows, but that stuff can just be elegantly hidden or worked around
  - â€¦with your help!
- fmWorkMate documentation
  - Whether it be correcting or making clearer existing documentation,
  - or documenting use cases
  - or making videos
- Issues
  - Found a bug? Create an [issue](https://github.com/mrwatson-de/fmWorkMate/issues)
  - Got an idea? Create an [issue](https://github.com/mrwatson-de/fmWorkMate/issues)
  - Missing  some documentation? Create an [issue](https://github.com/mrwatson-de/fmWorkMate/issues)
- Spreading the word
  - by mouth
  - by social media
  - by screencast

Feedback, Discussion, Ideas? -> bring it on!
